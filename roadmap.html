            <h3>Check Admission Requirements</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Every BCIT program has specific academic requirements. This step is about finding the gap
            between where you are now and what your target program needs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check required courses (e.g., English 12, Pre-Calculus 12, Science).</li>
            <li>Check minimum grades and any required tests or assessments.</li>
            <li>List which requirements you already meet and which ones you still need.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            Tip: Save screenshots or notes in your own document or planner, so you can share
            them easily with an advisor.
